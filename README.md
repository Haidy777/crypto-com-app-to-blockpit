Import crypto.com App Transactions into Blockpit.io

Currently there isn't an easy way to import Transactions from the crypto.com App into the Blockpit.io tax software.
As a developer I set out and built my own :)

Use at your own risk! The first time I imported I had a bunch of duplicates, but there is know duplicate detection. Be sure to check the Values in Blockpit after importing to see if they could be incorrect.
